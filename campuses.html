                    <h3>UM BANSALAN</h3>
                    <p>UM Bansalan College is a campus of the University of Mindanao (UM), located at the center of the
                        Municipality of Bansalan, Davao del Sur. Founded in 1962 under the name Mindanao Colleges, it
                        began
                        with 25 high school students in a two-room building and a faculty of five led by the late Mr.
                        Sofronio Bonjoc. After two years, Mr. Roldan L. Valle succeeded him. Through his vision and
                        commitment, the original wooden structure was expanded from two rooms to seven, eventually
                        growing
                        into a nine-room building by 1982.</p>
